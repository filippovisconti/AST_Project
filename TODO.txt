[ ] Create dictionary to hold module specification -> use class and id types from html
    [ ] "deprecated": false or true
[ ] Decide generic specification format
	- Check if parameters are mutually exclusive
[ ] Create generator for every file type (paths, boolean) and design mutation strategies - mutate system state and configuration -> keep it simple
